### Our Team

Here in Kaodim Engineering, we seek to solve problems. We are a small team of developers building solutions to serve a scale of thousands of transactions daily in the Southeast Asian marketplace. 

We scale our solutions to the data and feedback from our end users . We *pass the book* and believe in cross-discipline learning in order for us to build a cohesive strategy. We are experimental and pragmatic in problem solving. We agree and disagree in conversations, and are accountable for each other in execution. Above all else, we are a team inside and outside of the rat-race.

We are represented by four countries this year, seven historically. This comes with the perk of exchanging conversations about history, culture, politics, literature and the standard nerd-talk over meals. 

We have also held the gold medal to Kaodim's annual ping pong tournament two years in the running (2017). [Must be a tech thing](http://jamesyu.org/2009/01/11/why-table-tennis-is-a-great-hacker-sport/)
