# Interview Guide - 45m

The interview process with Kaodim Engineering consists of 2 rounds. 

Candidates will first be given a written assessment which covers the technical stack related to the positions they will interviewing for. These assessments will take the average applicant up to 4 hours to complete. The candidates are encouraged to illustrate and provide proof of concepts in their responses. 

In the second round, the candidates will be scheduled for a second round of technical interview in the office, or teleconferencing for remote candidates. The candidates should expect to employ the same skills in round 1, in person. 
After the technical questions, the candidates will be asked questions related to their personal achievements and motivations by the interviewing panel. 

Throughout the interview process, we assess candidates for skills that we believe will help them be successful in a startup environment.

In addition to that, we also seek to hire teammates who continue to add to the diversity of skills and personality within the team. 

We don't believe there's anything to gain by surprising candidates in an interview. Programmers don't typically code under pressure at real jobs. We want to see how you do when fully prepared, not when nervous. To that end, we list here the two types of questions we ask, how we evaluate them, common mistakes candidates make, and how they can avoid these mistakes.
