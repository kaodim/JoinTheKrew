# Interview Guide

## What to Expect
The interview process with Kaodim Engineering consists of 2 rounds. 

Candidates will first be given a written assessment which covers the technical stack related to the positions they will interviewing for. We expect these written assessments to take an average of 4 hours to complete. The candidates are encouraged to illustrate and provide proof of concepts in their responses. 

In the second round, the candidates will be scheduled for a second round of technical interview in the office, or teleconferencing for remote candidates. The candidates should expect to employ the same skills in round 1, in person. 

After the technical questions, the interviewing panel will proceed to ask questions about the candidates and what they seek to achieve during their tenure with the team.

## General notes

Throughout the interview process, we assess candidates for skills that we believe will help them be successful in a startup environment. 

In all the interview rounds, the candidates should employ google-fu to their comfort level, and be able communicate their thought processes. We do prefer engineers with a penchant for reading and writing documentation, too. We view the interview process as a learning process in itself for everyone, and would like to the candidates take advantage of it. 

We do not view the following attributes favorably during the interview process:

1. Clich√©, hand-wavy responses to technical questions.
2. General underpreparedness for the interview session. 
3. Egoistic, disinterest or intentionally flippant personalities.

##

We don't believe in hiring rockstars, wizards or imaginary creatures. 

We aim to continuously provide value to ourselves and the rest of the team, and seek to hire teammates who continue to add to the diversity of skills and personality within the team. To aid with that, we encourage the candidates to be natural, be comfortable and be prepared. 

We look forward to your applications just as much.

<!-- 
We don't believe there's anything to gain by surprising candidates in an interview. Programmers don't typically code under pressure at real jobs. We want to see how you do when fully prepared, not when nervous. To that end, we list here the two types of questions we ask, how we evaluate them, common mistakes candidates make, and how they can avoid these mistakes.
