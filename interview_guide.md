# Interview Guide - 45m

The interview process with Kaodim Engineering consists of 2 rounds after the preliminary written assessment.

Throughout the interview process, we assess candidates for skills that we believe will help them be successful in a startup environment.
In addition to that, we also seek to hire teammates who continue to add to the diversity of skills and personality within the team. 


We don't believe there's anything to gain by surprising candidates in an interview. Programmers don't typically code under pressure at real jobs. We want to see how you do when fully prepared, not when nervous. To that end, we list here the two types of questions we ask, how we evaluate them, common mistakes candidates make, and how they can avoid these mistakes.
